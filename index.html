            I Like to read intresting,fun,knowledgeable and big books in my free time.After school is over and I have completed my homework i like to read the famous series of Harry Potter by J.K Rowling who is a very nice and famous auther whose books are my favourite.Whenever I am bored and don't have anything to do,I only read books.I study in 5th standard and it is the most common hobby in my class.It said that "Reading a book in peace is the most wonderful things in our life".Reading books makes me a loyal,peaceful,punctual and teaches more values.And most off all,it makes ,me a successful person
